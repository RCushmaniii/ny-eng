/**
 * Rate limiting for the NY English Teacher Worker — D1-backed, shared across isolates.
 *
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * WHY NOT AN IN-MEMORY MAP
 *
 * The previous limiter was a module-level Map. Each isolate keeps its own copy
 * and isolates are recycled freely, so "5 bookings per hour" was really 5 per
 * isolate. A client opening a few parallel connections got a multiple of the
 * limit and the count reset on every cold start.
 *
 * WHY NOT CLOUDFLARE'S NATIVE [[ratelimits]] BINDING
 *
 * Measured on cushlabs-whatsapp, 2026-07-30: 420 sequential requests over one
 * keep-alive socket were refused at exactly the limit, but 1,500 requests over
 * 25 parallel connections were not refused at all. Its counter is isolate-local
 * too. That is a fine cheap first line in front of a surface that authenticates
 * before it spends. Nothing on this Worker qualifies:
 *
 *   POST /contact  sends an email. Unauthenticated, and it had NO limit at all
 *                  before this — an open relay for anyone who found the URL.
 *   POST /book     creates a real calendar event. Unauthenticated.
 *   GET  /slots    calls the Google Calendar API and burns quota.
 *
 * All three act before they authenticate, so the counter has to be genuinely
 * shared. This is the same module used by the cushlabs booking Worker, which
 * this Worker was the original of.
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

/**
 * Collapse a client address to the unit a limit should actually apply to.
 *
 * IPv4 whole; IPv6 truncated to its /64.
 *
 * A full IPv6 /128 is close to useless as a limiter key. Hosts rotate temporary
 * addresses under RFC 4941, every device on a LAN has its own, and a residential
 * subscriber is handed an entire /64 — so an abuser has 18 quintillion keys and
 * each request lands in a fresh bucket. Not theoretical: on cushlabs-whatsapp,
 * keying on the raw address let 1,500 requests from one machine through with
 * zero refusals. /64 is the smallest block routed to a single subscriber.

 * ACCURACY UNDER CONCURRENCY, measured against production 2026-07-30: 100
 * requests over 20-way parallelism against a limit of 60 → 81 allowed, 19
 * refused. The count is read before the insert, so requests arriving together
 * can all see the same pre-insert total and slip through. The overshoot is
 * bounded by how many land in one round trip, roughly 35% at that concurrency.
 *
 * That is fine for what this guards — a ceiling on Google Calendar quota and on
 * junk bookings, where a handful over the line costs nothing. It is NOT exact
 * quota accounting, so do not reuse this where the limit is a hard contractual
 * or billing boundary. Inserting before counting would tighten it, at the cost
 * of letting a refused request consume a slot and keep an attacker locked out
 * past the window — a worse trade here than the overshoot.
